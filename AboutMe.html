    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Campbell Carlson</h3>
    <p>Hey, I'm Campbell. I am 17 just coming out of highschool. During my highschool years I took an intrest in computer science, leading me to where I am now. I took JavaScript and Java courses during my later years in high school. In the past I have worked in construction (not super fun btw). In my free time I enjoy video games like League of Legends and Final Fantasy 14. When weather permits I enjoy skiing and mountain biking.</p>
